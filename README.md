# Coding Hackathon 1
This hub is designed to:
1. Distribute content to each team.
2. Track each team's progress as well as each individual's contributions.
3. Store your code, files, and notes.

Your hub can be accessed from any internet-enabled device for anywhere in the world.<br><br>

## Notes for First Time Github Users:
* As a safety precaution: **Make sure to backup your files offline.** You may decide to disregard this advice as you become more comfortable with how GitHub stores and updates files.
* It may be benefical to elect a *team maintainer* so that your original files do not accidentally get overwritten.
* Make use of branches before committing to your master branch.
